## Updates

## Corrections

One of the things I saw in the book was that a few figures are hard to read due to the small print. This is caused as a result of A) high content in a small are and B) print quality.

As the only thing I can change is currently the content and the scope it has on the page I will adjust this as much as possible. Amazon has agreements with various print companies in the world. They have to align to the quality requirements from Amazon but even that sometimes is open for interpretation.

Other parts I'm currently spending time on is proof-reading. Even though I've done my best to prevent mistakes, I've found a fair amount of spelling and grammar issues which I'm currently removing and/or correcting. I hope that this will also make it more easier to read.
